Sure! Let’s break this down step by step in a way that’s easy to understand.

### Overview

This code is like a recipe for making a smart chatbot that can remember past conversations and answer questions. Let’s go through each part of the code.

### 1. **Contextualize Q System Prompt**

```python
contextualize_q_system_prompt=(
    "Given a chat history and the latest user question"
    "Which might reference the context in the chat history"
    "formulate a standalone question which can be understood"
    "without the chain history do not answer the question"
    "just formulate it if needed otherwise return it as it is"
)
```

- **What It Means**: This is a set of instructions for the chatbot. It tells the bot to look at what has been said before (the chat history) and the latest question from the user.
- **Goal**: The bot needs to create a clear version of the latest question that doesn’t depend on past messages. If the question is already clear, it just uses that.

### 2. **Chat Prompt Template for Contextualization**

```python
contextualize_q_prompt=ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        ("system", contextualize_q_system_prompt),
        MessagesPlaceholder("chat_history"),
        ("human", "{input}"),
    ]
)
```

- **What It Does**: This creates a template for how messages will be organized in the chat.
- **Parts**:
  - **System Message**: Uses the instructions we just defined.
  - **Chat History**: A placeholder where all the earlier messages will go.
  - **User Input**: This is where the new question from the user will be placed.

### 3. **History-Aware Retriever**

```python
history_aware_retriever = create_history_aware_retriever(llm, retriever, contextualize_q_prompt)
```

- **What It Is**: This is a special tool that helps the bot remember past conversations while trying to find answers.
- **Components**:
  - **llm**: This is the language model (like the brain of the chatbot).
  - **retriever**: This tool helps find information.
  - **contextualize_q_prompt**: This is the template we created above.

### 4. **System Prompt for Question Answering**

```python
system_prompt= (
    "You are an assistant for question answer tasks"
    "Use the following piece of retrieved context to answer"
    "the question. if you do not know the answer, say that you"
    "do not know. use three sentences maximum and keep the answer"
    "concise"
    "\n\n"
    "{context}"
)
```

- **What It Means**: This tells the assistant how to answer questions.
- **Instructions**:
  - Use the information retrieved to provide an answer.
  - If the bot doesn’t know the answer, it should say so.
  - Keep answers short—only three sentences.

### 5. **Chat Prompt Template for QA**

```python
qa_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        ("system", system_prompt),
        MessagesPlaceholder("chat_history"),
        ("human", "{input}"),
    ]
)
```

- **What It Does**: This sets up another template, but this one is for answering questions.
- **Parts**:
  - The **system** message uses the answering instructions we just defined.
  - It also includes placeholders for the chat history and the user's new question.

### 6. **Question-Answer Chain**

```python
question_answer_chain = create_stuff_documents_chain(llm, qa_prompt)
```

- **What It Is**: This combines the language model with the question-answering template to create a process for answering questions.
- **How It Works**: When a question is asked, the bot knows how to find and generate an answer.

### 7. **Retrieval Chain**

```python
rag_chain = create_retrieval_chain(history_aware_retriever, question_answer_chain)
```

- **What It Does**: This connects the history-aware retriever with the question-answer chain.
- **Function**: It allows the bot to use past messages to help answer the current question.

### 8. **Get Session History Function**

```python
def get_session_history(session: str) -> BaseChatMessageHistory:
    if session_id not in st.session_state.store:
        st.session_state.store[session_id] = ChatMessageHistory()
    return st.session_state.store[session_id]
```

- **What It Means**: This is a function that retrieves the history of conversations for a specific user session.
- **How It Works**:
  - It checks if the session (like a chat room) already has saved messages.
  - If not, it creates a new history record.
  - It then returns the chat history for that session.

### 9. **Conversational RAG Chain**

```python
conversational_rag_chain = RunnableWithMessageHistory(
    rag_chain, get_session_history,
    input_messages_key="input",
    history_messages_key="chathistory",
    output_messages_key="answer"
)
```

- **What It Is**: This combines everything into a single runnable unit that can operate.
- **Components**:
  - **rag_chain**: This is the part that retrieves and answers questions.
  - **get_session_history**: This is the function to get the history of the chat.
  - It defines where to get the input, where to store history, and where to put the answer.

### Summary

In summary, this code sets up a smart chatbot that can remember past conversations and answer questions based on what users have asked previously. It’s like building a helpful assistant that listens, remembers, and responds clearly!




The two prompts you've provided serve different purposes in the context of a conversational AI system. Let's break down their differences:

### 1. **Contextualize Q System Prompt**

```plaintext
Given a chat history and the latest user question
Which might reference the context in the chat history
formulate a standalone question which can be understood
without the chain history do not answer the question
just formulate it if needed otherwise return it as it is
```

#### Purpose:
- **Function**: This prompt is designed to help the system rephrase or clarify the user's question based on the previous chat history.
- **Focus**: It emphasizes extracting the essence of the latest user question and ensuring that it stands alone. 
- **Instructions**:
  - Look at the chat history and the most recent question.
  - Create a clear, standalone version of the question.
  - Do **not** provide an answer; just reformulate the question if necessary, or return it unchanged.

### 2. **System Prompt for Question Answering**

```plaintext
You are an assistant for question answer tasks
Use the following piece of retrieved context to answer
the question. if you do not know the answer, say that you
do not know. use three sentences maximum and keep the answer
concise
\n\n
{context}
```

#### Purpose:
- **Function**: This prompt instructs the assistant on how to respond to a user’s question using context that has been retrieved.
- **Focus**: It is focused on the answering process rather than reformulating questions.
- **Instructions**:
  - The assistant is tasked with answering a question based on given context.
  - If the answer is unknown, the assistant should clearly state that it doesn’t know.
  - Answers should be concise, limited to three sentences.

### Summary of Differences

| Aspect                     | Contextualize Q System Prompt                          | System Prompt for Question Answering                     |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                | Reformulate user questions based on chat history      | Provide answers to questions using retrieved context     |
| **Focus**                  | Clarity and standalone nature of questions            | Generating concise answers                               |
| **Action Required**        | Formulate or return a question                         | Answer the question or state if unknown                 |
| **Output**                 | Standalone question                                    | Concise answer based on context                          |

In short, the first prompt is about clarifying user questions, while the second one is about providing answers to those questions.


The `BaseChatMessageHistory` is a class or interface typically used in conversational AI systems to manage and store the history of messages exchanged between a user and the assistant. Here’s a breakdown of what it generally entails:

### Purpose of `BaseChatMessageHistory`

1. **Store Conversation History**:
   - It keeps track of all messages sent during a chat session, allowing the system to maintain context and continuity in the conversation.

2. **Manage User and Assistant Messages**:
   - It records both user inputs and assistant responses, making it easier to refer back to previous exchanges when generating replies.

3. **Support Contextual Understanding**:
   - By maintaining a history of messages, the system can better understand the context of the current conversation, which is crucial for providing relevant and accurate responses.

### Key Features of `BaseChatMessageHistory`

1. **Add Messages**:
   - There are usually methods to add new messages to the history, including both user queries and assistant replies.

2. **Retrieve Messages**:
   - It allows retrieval of past messages, which can be useful for reference when formulating responses to new questions.

3. **Clear or Reset History**:
   - It may provide functionality to clear the history, which can be helpful for starting a new session without previous context.

4. **Format**:
   - The stored messages are typically formatted in a way that distinguishes between user and assistant messages, often including timestamps or identifiers.

### Example Usage in Code

In the code you provided, the `get_session_history` function uses `BaseChatMessageHistory` to manage chat sessions:

```python
def get_session_history(session: str) -> BaseChatMessageHistory:
    if session_id not in st.session_state.store:
        st.session_state.store[session_id] = ChatMessageHistory()
    return st.session_state.store[session_id]
```

### Breakdown of the Function:

- **Parameter**: 
  - `session`: This represents a unique identifier for a user's chat session.

- **Functionality**:
  - It checks if the `session_id` is already stored in `st.session_state.store`.
  - If not, it creates a new instance of `ChatMessageHistory` (which presumably extends or implements `BaseChatMessageHistory`) for that session.
  - Finally, it returns the chat message history for the specified session.

### Conclusion

`BaseChatMessageHistory` is a crucial component for managing conversation history in chat applications. It enables the assistant to maintain context throughout a session, which is essential for delivering coherent and contextually relevant responses to users' questions.



Sure! Let’s break down this code in simple terms.

### What This Code Does

1. **Check for Uploaded Files**:
   ```python
   if uploaded_files:
   ```
   - This line checks if there are any files that have been uploaded. If there are files, the code inside the `if` statement will run.

2. **Create an Empty List**:
   ```python
   documents = []
   ```
   - Here, we create an empty list called `documents`. This list will be used to store information about the uploaded files later.

3. **Loop Through Each Uploaded File**:
   ```python
   for uploaded_file in uploaded_files:
   ```
   - This line starts a loop. It goes through each file in the `uploaded_files` list one by one.

4. **Set a Temporary File Name**:
   ```python
   temppdf = f"./temp.pdf"
   ```
   - This line defines a temporary file name called `temp.pdf`. This is where the uploaded file will be saved temporarily on the computer.

5. **Open the Temporary File**:
   ```python
   with open(temppdf, "wb") as file:
   ```
   - This line opens the `temp.pdf` file for writing (`"wb"` means "write in binary mode"). The `with` statement ensures that the file is properly closed after we are done with it.

6. **Write the Uploaded File to the Temporary File**:
   ```python
   file.write(uploaded_file.getvalue())
   ```
   - Here, the code takes the contents of the uploaded file and writes it into `temp.pdf`. The `getvalue()` method gets the actual content of the uploaded file.

7. **Get the Name of the Uploaded File**:
   ```python
   file_name = uploaded_file.name
   ```
   - This line saves the name of the uploaded file in a variable called `file_name`. This can be useful later if you want to know what the user uploaded.

### Summary

In simple words, this code checks if any files have been uploaded. If there are, it creates a temporary file called `temp.pdf`, writes the contents of each uploaded file into this temporary file, and saves the name of the uploaded file for later use.
